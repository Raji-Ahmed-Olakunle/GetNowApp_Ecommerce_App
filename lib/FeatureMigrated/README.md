# Feature-Based Architecture (Fully Migrated)

This folder contains the fully migrated and refactored version of the app using feature-based Clean Architecture. All code from the original `Models`, `Providers`, `Screens`, and `Widgets` folders is organized into features, each with its own data, domain, and presentation layers.

- Each feature (e.g., products, auth, cart, orders, reviews, onboarding, profile, categories) has its own folder.
- Shared/core utilities remain in `lib/core/` or `lib/shared/`.
- This migration improves maintainability, scalability, and testability.
